				<h3>The Project</h3>
				<p>I worked as the lead UX designer on app for eBay&rsquo;s charity department in collaboration with the nonprofit Oregon Gear Up. I performed the user research and designed both the app&rsquo;s experience and interaction.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p>Low-income students in Oregon lack the tools and support to properly navigate the college admission and financial aid processes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>The Objective</h3>
				<p>Design a solution which will elucidate the application process and which guides users through its many facets, encouraging them to stay on track.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row row-gutter">
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>Checkpoints</h3>
				<p>The Checkpoints are broken down into subcomponents which help guide the user through each task&rsquo;s completion. The content hierarchy of blocks, tasks, and stages allows the user to multi-task while still providing helpful linear structure. Blocks contain a small set number of tasks. The user can only start tasks within their current block and can progress through these tasks concurrently.</p>

				<p>Only once all tasks in the current block are completed the user unlocks the next block of tasks. Each task has a small number of stages which the user completes one at a time and in a set order. The user may exit a task and the completed stages are saved. Once all the stages for a task are complete that task is complete as well. </p>

				<h3>Task Page</h3>
				<p>When the user selects a task from the checkpoints page, they navigate to its task page. Here, the use of a modal page allows the user to focus on the task at hand, working through each of its stages. The stages are represented as cards. By completing one stage, the user unlocks the next. The user can always scroll back through prior stages and edit the information saved there. The user&rsquo;s progress and placement within the task is tracked by the progress bar. Exiting the task saves the state of the task and returns the user to the Checkpoints page.</p>

				<h3>Persona Development</h3>
				<p>To better understand these student&rsquo;s needs, I needed to understand their behaviors. The team decided to focus on a narrow target audience, all members of the same demographic. All target users are Low-income high school seniors, who are either curious about college or who are already planning to apply.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>Needs and Goals</h3>
				<p>Provide a clear understanding about the options: which schools align with students individual interests and goals, financial aid opportunities and payment plans</p>
				<p>Foresight into the application process and associated deadlines</p>
				<p>Encouraging a sense of self-worth and determination throughout the college application process</p>
				<p>Enabling students to make the right decision for themselves</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>Behaviors and Beliefs</h3>
				<p>Staying on top of applications through effective time management is a challenge</p>
				<p>The components of college applications, including admission, financing, and attendance don’t fit together well</p>
				<p>College seems like a possibility, but isn’t worth trying to deal with all the complexity and paperwork</p>
