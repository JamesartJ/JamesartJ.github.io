		<p class="body-text">Ebay’s partnered with Oregon Gear Up as part of Ebay’s ongoing support of nonprofits. Oregon Gear Up is an Oregon based nonprofit which aims to help prepare low-income students for postsecondary programs. They attend different schools across the state to help encourage and facilitate college readiness. They work with school staff to  "design program activities that meet the needs of their community grounded in (their) research-based model.” Additionally, their website catalogs a list of steps to plan college applications, financial aid, and how to attend once accepted. I worked with Oregon Gear Up as part of Ebay's team to design a mobile app which would aid their organization’s cause.</p>

				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p class="body-text">
					Low-income students in Oregon lack the tools and support to properly navigate the college admission and financial aid processes.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="six columns">
				<h3>The Objective</h3>
				<p class="body-text">
					Design a solution which will elucidate the application process, and which guides users through its many facets, encouraging them to stay on track.

		<h3>Persona Development</h3>
		<p class="body-text">In order to better understand these student’s needs, I needed to understand their behaviors. The team decided to focus on a narrow target audience, all of the same demographic with similar behaviors, needs, and goals.</p>
		<h3>Demographic</h3>
		<p class="body-text">Low-income high school seniors, who are either curious about college or are already planning to apply.</p>
		<h3>Behaviors &amp Beliefs</h3>
		<ul class="body-text bullet">
			<li>College seems like a possibility, but isn’t worth trying to deal with all the complexity and paperwork</li>
			<li >The components of college application, including admittance, financing, and attendance don’t fit together well</li>
			<li>Unsure how to manage time effectively to stay on top of applications</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Needs &amp Goals</h3>
		<ul class="body-text bullet">
			<li>Understand college options fully: both possible schools and financing opportunities</li>
			<li>What steps to take and when to take them</li>
			<li>Keep track of all the application information for all of the platforms along the way</li>
			<li>Keep track of all their decisions and interests that help them make the right decision for themselves.</li>
		</ul>
