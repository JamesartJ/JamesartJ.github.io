				<h3>Event Feed</h3>
				<p>The Event Feed list needed to readily present the user with information that could quickly allow them to judge each event. Each event features a captivating image conveying its mood. Key details are also included so each user may instantly judge the feasibility of their attendance, and quickly evaluate their interest. At the top of the feed are two navigation elements: filter, and map/list view toggle. The filter allows users focus on events that suit their preference. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>Map View</h3>
				<p> Toggling from list to map allows each event to be viewed geographically. The map provides an intuitive means to convey event's locations. On both the map and list views of the Event Feed, the user can select an event which brings them to the event page. On the map view the user first selects an event to view its details and then taps the event again to be taken to its page.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>Filters</h3>
				<p>The settings page allows users to adjust filters on their Event Feed, and also access their account information. They can view popular events, either the most popular or those that are trending. Users can also sort by those that are closest or by those that are soonest. Additionally, a proximity range can be used to exclude events that are too far away. The account settings button takes them to the account settings page where they can edit their account information as well as their profile.</p>

				<h3>Event Page</h3>
				<p>On the event page, the map toggle element persists. This allows the user to rapidly view the location of the event relative to their own location. The event page allows the user to engage with the event, and also provides a more detailed description of the event. The user can perform two primary actions: like an event, and mark that they are attending. Only once a user has performed either of these actions can they engage with the event's comment chain. This encourages users to only discuss events once they've publicly expressed interest in them and promotes use of the app. The event poster is visible, so that users can view their profile and see more about them. This works well in the case of sponsored content where the poster is an organization hosting an event. A promoter's profile will show more information about their venue and other events.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>Profile</h3>
				<p>In making the profile, simplicity was paramount. I chose this route in order to combat the redundancy of an oversaturated social media landscape. The profile provides: a name (of student or venue), study location, a brief description, and affiliated school. Below is a list of the events that this user has posted. Tapping these events brings the user back to their event page.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>New Post</h3>
				<p>In order to encourage use of the app, it needed to be exceedingly easy for users to post events. In creating the "post an event" page, we worked to maximize usability by streamlining the post form to a single, intuitive page. The form auto-populates information based on the users current location. Tapping upload photo uses an iOS prompt where the user can take a picture or use a photo from their camera roll. Each input field takes in natural language, and interprets it into the event's information. Once the event is posted, the user is returned to their previous screen.</p>
