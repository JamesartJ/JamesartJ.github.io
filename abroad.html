		<h3>Identity</h3>
		<div class="row row-margin">
			<div class="four columns">
				<p>Abroad aims to unite students studying abroad and ultimately make them feel more comfortable and informed in foreign landscapes. As the tag-line: "live like a local abroad" suggests, Abroad allows students to share local events and places with others in their community. The app connects people and ensures they are in the loop. I then distilled these ideas into three distinct symbols.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<p>The person represents both the individual studying abroad, and the local, knowledgeable of their surroundings. Since the app serves as a platform for those two people to connect, the brand needed to convey that unity of people. In order to unify the person form, I used the loop. The loop symbolizes the coming together of individuals but also take its queue from the idea of "being in the loop". </p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<p>Lastly, the shape of the person combined with the loop mirrors the two blank spaces created by a traditional "A" working to promote the Abroad brand by paying homage to its name. The abroad app connects students studying abroad with nearby events. As such, the user group consists (primarily) of two demographics: college students and event promoters.</p>

				<h3>Event Feed</h3>
				<p>The event feed list needed to readily present the user with information that could quickly allow them to judge each event. Each event features a captivating image conveying its mood. Key details are also included so each user may instantly judge the feasibility of their attendance, and quickly evaluate their interest. 

				<br>
				<br>
				At the top of the event feed are two navigation elements: filter, and map/list view toggle. The filter allows users focus on events that suit their preference. Toggling from list to map allows each event to be viewed geographically. 

				<br>
				<br>
				The map provides an intuitive means to convey event&#39s locations.
				On both the map and list views of the event feed, the user can select an event which brings them to the event page. On the map view the user first selects an event to view its details and then taps the event again to be taken to its page.</p>

		<div class="row row-gutter">
			<div class="four columns">
				<h3>Event Page</h3>
				<p>On the event page, the map toggle element persists. This allows the user to rapidly view the location of the event relative to their own location. The event page allows the user to engage with the event, and also provides a more detailed description of the event. 

				<br>
				<br>
				Here, the user can perform two primary actions: like an event, and mark that they are attending. Only once a user has performed either of these actions can they engage with the event&#39s comment chain. This encourages users to only discuss events once they&#39ve publicly expressed interest in them and promotes use of the app.

				<br>
				<br>
				The event poster is visible, so that users can view their profile and see more about them. This works well in the case of sponsored content where the poster is an organization hosting an event. A promoter&#39s profile will show more information about their venue and other events. To help with on-boarding User&#39s can also copy a link to share with friends that will open to the event page within the app, or prompt them to download the app if they don&#39t have it. </p>

				<h3>Filters and Settings</h3>
				<p>The settings page allows users to adjust filters on their event feed, and also access their account information. They can view popular events, either the most popular or those that are trending. Users can also sort by those that are closest or by those that are soonest. Additionally, a proximity range can be used to exclude events that are too far away. The account settings button takes them to the account settings page where they can edit their account information as well as their profile.</p>
